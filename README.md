# Capstone_Micron_Final
For the final submission, I added LSTM analysis that was learned in the last lecture.  It is proven to be a superior method.

# Capstone_Micron
Capstone Project for AI/MI extension class

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?

#### Research Question
I am trying to see if there are any connections between Micron Stocks and the underlying daily DRAM price in the market.  How much daily changes in % would affect the Micron stock prices % change?  Both

#### Data Sources
I have gathered Micron (MU) stock prices from the stock market.  I have also downloaded the DRAM daily prices from DRAMExchange that covers the DRAM Spot market that dealers use to trade memory chips.

#### Methodology
I would use correlation, ACF/PACF, decomposition, and ARIMA to look at the data

#### Results
When daily memory prices do change more than +/-0.5% then the stock of Micron would be affected by more significant % change.

#### Next stepsI
I need to explore if there are other techniques that would better estimate the results.
